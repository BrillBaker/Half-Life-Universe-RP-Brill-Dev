This is a gamemode called Cascade. It's kind of like a Half-Life themed SCP: Secret Laboratory. There are eight teams that all serve a unique purpose. Items, weapons, Xen aliens, and map obstructions spawn randomly around the map.

# Teams

## Scientist
- First team to spawn when the round starts
- Has access to the spawn menu to build contraptions that could help them escape
- Default weapons: Tool gun, physgun, gravity gun
- Primary objective: Escape

## Facility Administrator
- Does not spawn with any weapons, must scavenge or meet up with HECU Marines
- Primary objective: Stop non-military personnel from leaving the facility

## Visitor
- Default team that players spawn as in the waiting room
- Players who join the server during an active round will be spawned in the waiting room

## Medic
- Default weapons: Medkit
- Primary objective: Avoid capture by security and scientists and meet up with HECU Marines

## HECU Marine
- Players who die before the round ends will respawn as a HECU Marine in the next wave
- Default weapons: Random shotgun or rifle, battering ram
- Primary objective: Kill all facility personnel and meet up with the facility administrator

## Security Officer

# Map Obstructions
Obstructions spawn randomly around the map each round. They block certain paths to add variety so players can't take the same escape route every time, since Gmod does not support procedural generation of maps like the SCP games have. There are two types of obstructions.

## Large Fire
- Burns players that get too close
- Can be extinguished by finding a fire extinguisher, which spawn in cases mounted to the walls of certain areas.

## Collapsed Ceiling
- Large pile of rubble that cannot be removed or bypassed

# Other Important Items

## Tram Controller
- Allows players to toggle power to the tram
- Adds risk to using the tram

## Escape Vehicle
- Truck that randomly spawns at one of the two topside entrances
- Used to escape from the facility
